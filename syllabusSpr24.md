## Course Description:

The novel, whose very name is associated with the new, is starting to look a bit antiquated. It demands of us long, uninterrupted stretches of time; it projects a world hermetically sealed from the buzzing data flows that travel in our pockets and around our desks; it resolutely resists—Kindles and iPhones notwithstanding—being ripped from between printed covers and scattered in the cloud(s). This course will examine the past and future of the novel genre, attempting to link the history of what William Warner calls the dominant entertainment platform of the nineteenth century to the present moment, in which an increasing share of our “serious” reading and “light” entertainments alike unfold on networked screens of all kinds.
We will examine this dynamic along two axes. First, we will read classic and recent work on the history and theory of the novel, with a particular emphasis on reading practices and cultural technologies. Second, we will *do things* with novels other than simply read them, exploring new possibilities for engaging the genre via the affordances of digital technology. For example, we will *remediate* a printed novel by creating a DIY audiobook; we will *transform* a novel by “playing” it as a role-playing-game; we will *annotate* a novel, creating a new edition to orient lay readers to its cultural historical underpinnings.
Oh, and we'll also dip into the weird, wonderful, challenging world of Herman Melville for a minute. You won't regret it. 

**Requirements**: rigorous reading, informal writing (on a course blog), enthusiastic participation, participation in collaborative digital projects and a final essay or project. Honors students will complete a more robust final project than Capstone students: details forthcoming.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester, students will gain

- knowledge of overarching themes of the “digital humanities”
- mastery of several techniques associated with the digital humanities, including the collaborative production and publication of textual editions (e.g., audiobook, annotated edition), the use of games as a mode of scholarly inquiry, and the use of digital text analysis techniques
- awareness of historical antecedents for emerging cultural technologies, such as the audiobook and the online edition
- experience writing in shared, collaborative online writing spaces and practices, especially the WordPress blogging platform
- familiarity with several landmark literary  texts, and critical discussions of them

## Technology:

We will use open-access resources via the CUNY Academic Commons rather than BlackBoard this term. You will use:

* a course blog (using WordPress) for sharing informal writing with classmates and engaging in intellectual exchange about course materials with me and with each other.
* a course "group" that is basically a listserv and document archive for .pdfs and other materials you'll need.

There's a bit of work to get up and going on the Commons, and we'll cover those steps together in class. Most students find it a fun and engaging space for reading/writing, with more curb appeal and flexibility than Bb!

## Writing and Research Help

In addition to course assignments and instruction, the [Reading/Writing Center](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/rwc) can help you to improve your literacy skills and develop your writing style.

For research help, Hunter College Libraries provide online databases and other remote resources. Hunter librarians can help you leverage these resources for your projects. Here are some ways:

- [Five ways to contact the library](https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/ask-a-librarian)
- Contact English subject librarian [Jennifer Newman](mailto: jn1314@hunter.cuny.edu). 
- Instructions to access the Hunter Library from off-campus are here: [https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/remote-access](https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/remote-access).

## Attendance/Participation:

Faculty are required to certify student attendance. You are urged to keep abreast of any attendance requirements that may be set by Hunter, government agencies or others with regards to qualification for financial aid, fulltime status, etc.

Except as stipulated by Hunter policy, your course grades may be based on assignments (which may include presentations and participation in group activities) and in-class activities, but not on attendance *per se*. I do expect regular, vigorous participation in our discussions and other activities. Having said, that, I recognize that there may be factors beyond your control that inhibit the quality and quantity of your participation (e.g., childcare issues, sickness, etc.). Please reach out if you have issues and plan ahead when possible.

Please do your best to contact me if you cannot take part in the course due to illness or an emergency. Let me know if you will be unable to access the course site or the internet for a week or more. Depending on the circumstances it may be possible to schedule alternatives to activities that you miss. Remember that to be excused, medicals must indicate that you were incapable of working on the assignment while confined.
