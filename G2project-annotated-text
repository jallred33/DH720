## Project Description (due 11/7 in class)

In this second group project, you will once again divide into teams and create a quick-and-dirty "edition" of a fictional text of your choosing. The overarching purpose of this project is to put the theories of Barthes, Iser, Drucker, et al. into practice by transforming a plain text into an edition characterized by a myriad of "paratextual" elements like titles, headings, fonts, footnotes, images, etc. and by, perhaps, "affordances" that invite readers to "do things with" the text in particular ways (e.g., annotations, glosses, links to external resources). 

Obviously, it takes many hands and several years to create a publishable edition of a literary text, so we will keep our expectations modest and emphasize the process of collaboration and the experimentation with the affordances, design choices, and relationship with "implied readers" that digital publication allows. Each student will be assigned to a team, and each team will decide **what text** to work on, **what platform or approach** to use to deliver it to readers, and **what elements** to build into the text to add value for a readership imagined in specific, deliberate ways.

The division of labor and workflow might be harder to establish than with the first group project. You will want to designate (a) presenter(s) as before, but how you divide the work of background research and/or resource acquisition, design of the text itself, and testing/quality control will vary according to the goals and parameters you set.

As before,you may want to use Slack or Google Docs or something similar to manage the workflow. The groups are small enough where things shouldn’t get terribly complicated, but it’s helpful to think through how to communicate from the outset. The project is due on **11/7**, when you'll present it to the class as a whole.

Again, as before, the last requirement is that you compose **a brief post for the blog** (500 words or so) reflecting on a) the process/product as a whole and b) your specific role within it, with an emphasis on what the experience taught you that merely reading *about* annotation and textual editing would have missed. The post is due on **11/14**.

## Evaluation/Criteria

You will be evaluated on the following criteria, which I will not boil down to a simple rubric, since they all interact with one another in subtle ways:
* **adventurousness**: does the text take risks, or just play it safe? Does the edition resemble other standard "critical editions" in print, or does it do something new, using digital affordances to engage readers in novel ways or devise a new angle on the text that will be fresh to readers?
* **quality**: is the product accessible and user-friendly? Does it articulate a clear relationship between the "primary text" and your "secondary" comments on it? Was some attention paid to aesthetics and design?
* **reflectiveness**: does the presentation (and the discussion in the seminar and on the blog) reflect careful thinking about the project? Did the secondary readings by Barthes, Iser, Drucker, et al. inform the project in any way?

All group members will receive a collective grade for the group’s work. This can be unfair, I realize, and a given member can be uncooperative or unresponsive, but that’s also true in postgraduate life, so it’s good practice. Each of you will receive individual grades for your reflective post, as well. And all of the group projects will be folded into one grade (20% of total grade), so each project is “low stakes.” If your group is having problems (or has one problem member) you are encouraged to contact me privately for help.
As you plan your attack on this project, feel free to be a bit zany. It may be that “quality” and “adventurousness” are somewhat at odds (since it’s easier to have good quality if you know what you’re aiming for and easier to experiment if you’re not worried too much about quality), so consciously decide what you’re going for, go for it well, and have fun. I’d be tempted to play with the following (not a list for you to copy, necessarily, but a springboard for dreaming about it):

* **creating a multimodal text**: fictional texts often gesture to non-verbal phenomena, using ekphrasis (the verbal representation of visual phenomena) or other means to capture audio and/or visual and/or tactile experience in words. You might create an edition that leans into this aspect of a given novel, such that Ellison's *Invisible Man* has links to Armstrong's "Black and Blue" (referenced in the Prologue) or James's *Portrait of a Lady* has links to the recognizable paintings that are referenced in the text.
* **showing the "reception history" of a text**: you might show your readers some traces of past readers' recorded responses to the text. I could imagine, for example, an edition of Stowe that highlights polemical responses to the text amid the rising tide of abolitionist fervor and reaction against it in the 1850s. Or an edition of Eliot's long poem *The Waste-Land* that draws on Rainey's archival digging that excavated the reactions of the first wave of Eliot's readers, attempting to make sense of the poem.
* **inviting readers into the text**: using hypothes.is or similar, you might create an edition that builds in the responses of readers and makes their marginalia visible to the entire reading community. This would underscore the social dimension of reading and cast readers as "produsers" in the sense discussed by Weber regarding Librivox.


## Example of Student Work:

*  [here is an edition of Jean Toomer's *Cane* using the Genius platform](https://genius.com/Jean-toomer-cane-a-critical-introduction-annotated) from my 2020 class: enjoy and think about how you might approach things. 

## addendum: what text to choose?!

### principles/advice
* public domain texts are fun, since they’re free to access and can be published at the end if you like
* books published in 1926 or before are generally in the public domain in the US. 
* recent entrants among literary classics include: Woolf's *Mrs. Dalloway*, Hemingway's *In Our Time* and *The Sun Also Rises*, Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*, Faulkner's *Soldier's Pay*, Dos Passos's *Manhattan Transfer*, Du Bose Heyward's *Porgy* (bad novel, but basis of the Gershwin "folk opera," which could be interesting to explore).

### ideas
I'll also repeat these suggestions for the audiobook assignment, since some of those suggestions would also lend themselves to this approach:

* Jean Toomer, *Cane*: experimental 1925 mix of modernist poetry and prose, loosely bound around themes of mediating between rural/urban and folk/cosmopolitain subjects and spaces in 1920s African American life. Recently in the public domain. At 64k words, you’ll want to do a condensed version, I would think, which is very doable, given the motley aspect of the text. Would be interesting to mix with music from the period.
* James Weldon Johnson, *The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man*: featuring extravagant narrative play and a charming narrator, Johnson’s classic deconstruction of race might be fun to pair with public domain recordings from the e20thC, especially given Johnson’s relationship to Tin Pan Alley.
