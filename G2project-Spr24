## Project Description 

The overarching purpose of this project is to put the theories of Barthes, Drucker, et al. into practice by collaborating on "editions" of a text, in this case Melville's _Benito Cereno_. Obviously, it takes many hands and several years to create a publishable edition of a literary text, so we will keep our expectations modest and emphasize the **process** of collaboration and the **experimentation** with the affordances, design choices, and relationship with "implied readers" that digital publication allows. 

The division of labor and workflow might be harder to establish than with the first group project. You will want to designate (a) presenter(s) as before, but how you divide the work of background research and/or resource acquisition, design of the text itself, and testing/quality control will vary according to the goals and parameters you set. You'll want to work from the clean, well-edited plain text of *Benito* from Project Gutenberg [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15859). Note that *Benito* is found in *The Piazza Tales*, the collection in which it was first published in book form.

As before,you may want to use WhatsApp or Google Docs or something similar to manage the workflow. The groups are small enough where things shouldn’t get terribly complicated, but it’s helpful to think through how to communicate from the outset. The project is due on **3/21** , when you'll present it to the class as a whole.

Again, as before, the last requirement is that you compose **a brief post for the blog** (500 words or so) reflecting on a) the process/product as a whole and b) your specific role within it, with an emphasis on what the experience taught you that merely reading *about* annotation and textual editing would have missed. The post is due on **3/25** .

## Evaluation/Criteria

*   evaluation will be very similar to last time, with a group comment/grade and an individual comment/grade. The criteria are only slightly changed:
    *   **adventurousness**: does the text take risks, or just play it safe? Does the edition resemble other standard "critical editions" in print, or does it do something new, using digital affordances to engage readers in novel ways or devise a new angle on the text that will be fresh to readers?
    *   **quality**: is the product accessible and user-friendly? Does it articulate a clear relationship between the "primary text" and your "secondary" comments on it? Was some attention paid to aesthetics and design?
    *   **reflectiveness**: does the presentation (and the discussion in the seminar and on the blog) reflect careful thinking about the project? Did the secondary readings by Barthes, Bauer/Zirker, Iser, Drucker, et al. inform the project in any way?

All group members will receive a collective grade for the group’s work. This can be unfair, I realize, and a given member can be uncooperative or unresponsive, but that’s also true in postgraduate life, so it’s good practice. Each of you will receive individual grades for your reflective post, as well. And all of the group projects will be folded into one grade (20% of total grade), so each project is “low stakes.” If your group is having problems (or has one problem member) you are encouraged to contact me privately for help.
As you plan your attack on this project, feel free to be a bit zany. It may be that “quality” and “adventurousness” are somewhat at odds (since it’s easier to have good quality if you know what you’re aiming for and easier to experiment if you’re not worried too much about quality), so consciously decide what you’re going for, go for it well, and have fun. I’d be tempted to play with the following (not a list for you to copy, necessarily, but a springboard for dreaming about it):

* **creating a multimodal text**: fictional texts often gesture to non-verbal phenomena, using ekphrasis (the verbal representation of visual phenomena) or other means to capture audio and/or visual and/or tactile experience in words. You might create an edition that leans into this aspect of the novel, looking at past visualizations from old editions on the Internet Archive, Hathi Trust, or other sources of public-domain imagery. You could also illustrate with some examples of the nautical objects found in the text: the elaborate knots, the oakum, the "poop," and so on.
* **showing the "reception history" of a text**: you might show your readers some traces of past readers' recorded responses to the text. I could imagine, for example, an edition of Melville that shows how the reception history reflects changing ideas about race and about the legacy of slavery in US culture. The Norton gives you a good start in its sampling of criticism. JSTOR is a wonderful source for lit crit writing going back at least to the early 20thC.
* **inviting readers into the text**: using hypothes.is or similar, you might create an edition that builds in the responses of readers and makes their marginalia visible to the entire reading community. This would underscore the social dimension of reading and cast readers as "produsers" in the sense discussed by Weber regarding Librivox. It might be interesting to recruit a band of "naive readers," in the sense that they haven't read the text and agree (kind of like a jury) not to "read ahead" or consult Sparknotes or Wikipedia or whatever, and log their growing awareness of the "real" situation aboard the San Dominick in the margins. You might think about ways to guide the readers' experience with prompts or notes that enhance the experience without giving up the game.
* **examining the Middle Passage in the text**: what precursors to Melville's text exist in the historiographic literature? Where might Babo have gotten the idea to hijack the ship and return to Senegal? You might look at histories of the transport of enslaved people (or histories of piracy) and build some notes that draw from this work.
* **linking the primary text to its "source text"**: The Norton already does some of this, but you could dig more deeply to show how Melville shaped Delano's memoir (which is easily findable on Hathi Trust, the IA, Google Books, etc. and is excerpted in the Norton Edition you have). What did Melville change from the source text, and why?
